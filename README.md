Ready


## Running the application
### Prerequisites
In order to run the application, Python 3.9 or higher is required.
Necessary packages are listed in `requirements.txt` file - they
will be installed automatically in the following steps.

### Preparation
The preferred form of launching the application is through a virtual environment.
To facilitate environment creation and requirements installation, `prepare.sh` script contained in the
main directory can be launched.

### Running
*Manually*: For manual activation, run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment and `deactivate` to finish. While the environment is activated, run your commands as you normally would using `python3` as your interpreter.

*Automatically*: In order to automatically launch a ready configuration, use `run.sh` script to run the app using the newly created virtual environment.
Currently the script does not launch anything, as database automization is not supported yet. This content will be updated accordingly.
